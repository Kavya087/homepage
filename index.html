        <p>
          This project aims to understand when and why AI-supported decision tools
          succeed, fail, or backfire in international development settings.
          Rather than asking whether a tool is technically accurate, we focus on
          whether it is accepted, sustained, and beneficial in real communities
          over time.
        </p>

        <p>Specifically, the project has three goals:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Identify human and psychological conditions that affect uptake.</strong>
            We study how risk perceptions, learning from experience, trust, and
            social influence shape whether communities adopt and continue using
            decision tools—and which forms of additional support can compensate
            for these constraints.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Understand how decision tools can cause long-run harm despite short-run success.</strong>
            We examine conditions under which tools that improve outcomes initially
            may increase vulnerability, reduce welfare, or undermine trust over time.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Assess how geography and environmental context shape uptake and persistence.</strong>
            We analyze how climate variability, environmental feedbacks, and
            geographical conditions influence whether the same tool succeeds in
            one place and fails in another, and how design or support can mitigate
            these differences.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Together, these goals aim to show not only whether decision tools work,
          but under what conditions they can be responsibly and effectively deployed.
        </p>

      <section aria-labelledby="approach">
  <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>

  <p>
    We use dynamic systems modeling to study the interaction between decision
    tools, household behavior under risk, social learning, and environmental
    feedbacks.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Purpose of the Model</h3>
  <p>
    This agent-based model (ABM) simulates how fishers in a local community
    decide whether to adopt and continue using an AI-supported fisheries app
    over time.
  </p>
  <p>The model focuses on five core drivers of uptake:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trust</li>
    <li>Perceptions of risk</li>
    <li>Learning from past outcomes</li>
    <li>Peer influence</li>
    <li>Environmental variability</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Model Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The model represents a fishing community composed of individual fishers
    (agents) connected through a social network. Each season, fishers decide
    whether to use the app based on their trust, past experiences, perceived
    risk, and what their peers are doing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Environmental conditions vary across seasons, influencing both fishing
    outcomes and how fishers interpret the app’s performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The model runs over multiple time periods (e.g., fishing seasons) and
    tracks how adoption evolves.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Agents</h3>
  <p>
    Each fisher is represented as an agent with the following characteristics:
  </p>

  <h4>3.1 Trust</h4>
  <p>Represents confidence in the app and the institution behind it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increases gradually after positive experiences</li>
    <li>Decreases sharply after negative experiences</li>
    <li>Is influenced by the trust levels of peers</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3.2 Perceived Risk</h4>
  <p>Represents how risky it feels to rely on the app.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Increases after bad outcomes</li>
    <li>Increases when environmental conditions are highly unpredictable</li>
    <li>Decreases when many peers successfully use the app</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>3.3 Belief in Usefulness</h4>
  <p>
    Represents the fisher’s belief that the app improves outcomes (e.g., catch,
    safety, income).
  </p>
  <p>Beliefs update over time based on personal experience.</p>
  <p>Negative experiences may carry more weight than positive ones.</p>

  <h4>3.4 Adoption Status</h4>
  <p>Each season, a fisher either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uses the app</li>
    <li>Does not use the app</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Adoption is probabilistic and depends on trust, beliefs, perceived risk,
    environmental conditions, and peer behavior.
  </p>

  <h4>3.5 Social Network</h4>
  <p>Each fisher observes a set of peers.</p>
  <p>Peer influence affects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Willingness to adopt</li>
    <li>Trust updates</li>
    <li>Perceived risk</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Fishers may copy behavior or confidence from their social contacts.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Environment</h3>
  <p>
    Each season has a level of environmental variability.
  </p>
  <p>Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stable conditions</li>
    <li>Moderately variable conditions</li>
    <li>Highly volatile conditions (storms, shifting fish patterns, unusual weather)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Environmental variability affects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The reliability of fishing outcomes</li>
    <li>The clarity of feedback about whether the app is helpful</li>
    <li>Perceived risk</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Higher variability makes outcomes noisier and learning more difficult.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Seasonal Dynamics</h3>
  <p>Each season unfolds in the following sequence:</p>

  <h4>Step 1: Environmental Conditions Realize</h4>
  <p>The season is characterized by a specific level of variability.</p>

  <h4>Step 2: Social Observation</h4>
  <p>Fishers observe:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which peers are using the app</li>
    <li>Whether peers appear satisfied or dissatisfied</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 3: Adoption Decision</h4>
  <p>This decision depends on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Trust</li>
    <li>Belief in usefulness</li>
    <li>Perceived risk</li>
    <li>Environmental conditions</li>
    <li>Peer behavior</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Step 4: Outcomes Occur</h4>
  <p>Fishers experience fishing outcomes.</p>
  <p>If using the app, outcomes may be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Better than baseline</li>
    <li>Worse than baseline</li>
    <li>Ambiguous due to environmental noise</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In volatile seasons, even a useful app may appear ineffective.
  </p>

  <h4>Step 5: Updating</h4>
  <p>Fishers update:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Beliefs about usefulness</li>
    <li>Trust</li>
    <li>Perceived risk</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Highly visible failures may reduce trust across the entire community.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Possible System Dynamics</h3>

  <h4>6.1 Gradual Diffusion</h4>
  <p>Adoption increases steadily as trust builds and peers influence others.</p>

  <h4>6.2 Fragility</h4>
  <p>A single extreme season reduces trust significantly.</p>

  <h4>6.3 Trust Collapse</h4>
  <p>A public or widely discussed failure causes rapid decline in adoption.</p>

  <h4>6.4 Persistent Inequality</h4>
  <p>Risk-averse or resource-constrained fishers may never adopt.</p>

  <h4>6.5 Context-Dependent Success</h4>
  <p>
    The same app may succeed in moderately variable environments but struggle
    in highly volatile environments.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Policy and Design Experiments</h3>
  <p>The model allows simulation of interventions such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Training programs that accelerate trust-building</li>
    <li>Human facilitation to reduce perceived risk</li>
    <li>Subsidies lowering adoption barriers</li>
    <li>Communication strategies after failures</li>
    <li>Different network structures (central influencers vs decentralized communities)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>8. Outputs Tracked</h3>
  <p>Over time, the model tracks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Overall adoption rate</li>
    <li>Trust distribution</li>
    <li>Dropout rates</li>
    <li>Sensitivity to environmental shocks</li>
    <li>Differences across subgroups</li>
    <li>Stability versus collapse of uptake</li>
  </ul>
