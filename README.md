# Project Goals

This project aims to understand when and why AI-supported decision tools succeed, fail, or backfire in international development settings. Rather than asking whether a tool is technically accurate, we focus on whether it is accepted, sustained, and beneficial in real communities over time.

Specifically, the project has three goals:

Identify human and psychological conditions that affect uptake. We study how risk perceptions, learning from experience, trust, and social influence shape whether communities adopt and continue using decision tools—and which forms of additional support can compensate for these constraints.
Understand how decision tools can cause long-run harm despite short-run success. We examine conditions under which tools that improve outcomes initially may increase vulnerability, reduce welfare, or undermine trust over time.
Assess how geography and environmental context shape uptake and persistence. We analyze how climate variability, environmental feedbacks, and geographical conditions influence whether the same tool succeeds in one place and fails in another, and how design or support can mitigate these differences.
Together, these goals aim to show not only whether decision tools work, but under what conditions they can be responsibly and effectively deployed.

# Approach

We use dynamic systems modeling to study the interaction between decision tools, household behavior under risk, social learning, and environmental feedbacks.
