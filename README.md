# Project Goals

This project aims to understand when and why AI-supported decision tools succeed, fail, or backfire in international development settings.

Rather than asking whether a tool is technically accurate, we focus on whether it is **accepted, sustained, and beneficial in real communities over time**.

Specifically, the project has three goals:

1. **Identify human and psychological conditions that affect uptake.**  
   We study how risk perceptions, learning from experience, trust, and social influence shape whether communities adopt and continue using decision tools—and which forms of additional support can compensate for these constraints.

2. **Understand how decision tools can cause long-run harm despite short-run success.**  
   We examine conditions under which tools that improve outcomes initially may increase vulnerability, reduce welfare, or undermine trust over time.

3. **Assess how geography and environmental context shape uptake and persistence.**  
   We analyze how climate variability, environmental feedbacks, and geographical conditions influence whether the same tool succeeds in one place and fails in another, and how design or support can mitigate these differences.

Together, these goals aim to show not only whether decision tools work, but under what conditions they can be responsibly and effectively deployed.

# Approach

## 1. Purpose of the Model

This agent-based model (ABM) simulates how fishers in a local community decide whether to adopt and continue using an AI-supported fisheries app over time.

The model focuses on five core drivers of uptake:

- Trust  
- Perceptions of risk  
- Learning from past outcomes  
- Peer influence  
- Environmental variability  

---

## 2. Model Overview

The model represents a fishing community composed of individual fishers (agents) connected through a social network.

Each season, fishers decide whether to use the app based on:

- Trust  
- Past experiences  
- Perceived risk  
- Peer behavior  

Environmental conditions vary across seasons, influencing both fishing outcomes and how fishers interpret the app’s performance.

The model runs over multiple time periods (e.g., fishing seasons) and tracks how adoption evolves.

---

## 3. Agents

Each fisher is represented as an agent with the following characteristics:

### 3.1 Trust

Represents confidence in the app and the institution behind it.

- Increases gradually after positive experiences  
- Decreases sharply after negative experiences  
- Influenced by the trust levels of peers  

### 3.2 Perceived Risk

Represents how risky it feels to rely on the app.

- Increases after bad outcomes  
- Increases when environmental conditions are highly unpredictable  
- Decreases when many peers successfully use the app  

### 3.3 Belief in Usefulness

Represents the fisher’s belief that the app improves outcomes (e.g., catch, safety, income).

- Beliefs update over time based on personal experience  
- Negative experiences may carry more weight than positive ones  

### 3.4 Adoption Status

Each season, a fisher either:

- Uses the app  
- Does not use the app  

Adoption is probabilistic and depends on:

- Trust  
- Beliefs  
- Perceived risk  
- Environmental conditions  
- Peer behavior  

### 3.5 Social Network

Each fisher observes a set of peers.

Peer influence affects:

- Willingness to adopt  
- Trust updates  
- Perceived risk  

Fishers may copy behavior or confidence from their social contacts.

### 3.6 Resource Constraints

Represents a fisher’s ability to weather a bad season or absorb losses.

Resource-constrained fishers:

- Are more vulnerable to single negative outcomes  
- May be more risk-averse about trying new approaches  
- Have less capacity to experiment or learn through trial and error  
- Face higher stakes in adoption decisions  

Resource levels may also affect:

- Persistence after setbacks  
- Willingness to invest time in learning the app  
- Ability to access complementary resources (fuel, equipment)  

### 3.7 Time Horizons

Represents how far into the future a fisher weighs outcomes when making decisions.

Variation may reflect:

- Age  
- Health status  
- Family obligations and succession planning  
- Alternative livelihood options  

Fishers with longer time horizons:

- May tolerate short-term uncertainty for long-term gains  
- May invest more in learning and skill-building  
- May be less deterred by initial setbacks  

Time horizons interact with environmental variability. In highly volatile contexts, even patient fishers may discount the future more heavily.

### 3.8 Alternative Information Sources

Represents access to and trust in other sources of knowledge.

Sources may include:

- Traditional ecological knowledge passed down through generations  
- Personal fishing experience  
- Observations of environmental cues (weather, water conditions, bird behavior)  
- Informal networks and elder fishers  

Fishers with strong alternative information sources:

- May be less dependent on the app  
- May use the app selectively rather than as a replacement  
- May evaluate app advice against traditional knowledge  
- May be slower to adopt if recommendations conflict with established practices  

The relationship between traditional knowledge and app-based guidance may be:

- **Complementary** — app confirms or refines existing knowledge  
- **Contradictory** — app suggests different approaches  
- **Context-dependent** — each works better in different conditions  

### 3.9 Technology Access and Literacy

Represents familiarity with smartphones and digital tools, as well as practical access.

Variation includes:

- Prior experience with mobile phones or apps  
- Literacy and numeracy levels  
- Language compatibility  
- Physical access to devices (ownership vs. sharing)  
- Network connectivity and data costs  

Fishers with lower technology literacy or access:

- Face higher barriers to initial adoption  
- Require more support and training  
- May use the app less effectively even when adopted  
- May rely on intermediaries or facilitators  
- May experience the app differently (e.g., voice vs. text interface)  

Technology constraints can create persistent inequality in adoption and benefits, even when the app is freely available.

## 4. Environment

Each season has a level of environmental variability.

Examples include:

- Stable conditions  
- Moderately variable conditions  
- Highly volatile conditions (storms, shifting fish patterns, unusual weather)  

Environmental variability affects:

- Reliability of fishing outcomes  
- Clarity of feedback about whether the app is helpful  
- Perceived risk  

Higher variability makes outcomes noisier and learning more difficult.

---

## 5. Seasonal Dynamics

Each season unfolds in the following sequence:

**Step 1: Environmental Conditions Realize**  
The season is characterized by a specific level of variability.

**Step 2: Social Observation**  
Fishers observe:
- Which peers are using the app  
- Whether peers appear satisfied or dissatisfied  

**Step 3: Adoption Decision**  
Each fisher decides whether to use the app based on:
- Trust  
- Belief in usefulness  
- Perceived risk  
- Environmental conditions  
- Peer behavior  

**Step 4: Outcomes Occur**  
Fishers experience fishing outcomes.

If using the app, outcomes may be:
- Better than baseline  
- Worse than baseline  
- Ambiguous due to environmental noise  

In volatile seasons, even a useful app may appear ineffective.

**Step 5: Updating**  
Fishers update:
- Beliefs about usefulness  
- Trust  
- Perceived risk  

Highly visible failures may reduce trust across the entire community.

## 6. Possible System Dynamics

The model can generate multiple realistic patterns:

### 6.1 Gradual Diffusion  
Adoption increases steadily as trust builds and peers influence others.

### 6.2 Fragility  
A single extreme season significantly reduces trust.

### 6.3 Trust Collapse  
A public or widely discussed failure causes rapid decline in adoption.

### 6.4 Persistent Inequality  
Risk-averse or resource-constrained fishers may never adopt.

### 6.5 Context-Dependent Success  
The same app may:
- Succeed in moderately variable environments  
- Struggle in highly volatile environments  

---

## 7. Policy and Design Experiments

The model allows simulation of interventions such as:

- Training programs that accelerate trust-building  
- Human facilitation to reduce perceived risk  
- Subsidies lowering adoption barriers  
- Communication strategies after failures  
- Different network structures (central influencers vs decentralized communities)  

---

## 8. Outputs Tracked

Over time, the model tracks:

- Overall adoption rate  
- Trust distribution  
- Dropout rates  
- Sensitivity to environmental shocks  
- Differences across subgroups  
- Stability versus collapse of uptake
